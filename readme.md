**Difference Between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2:**

A Detailed Comparison
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has been the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web since the early days of the internet. Over time, HTTP has evolved to meet the growing demands of modern web applications. The two most widely used versions today are HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this blog, we’ll explore the key differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, and why upgrading to HTTP/2 can significantly improve web performance.

**What is HTTP/1.1?**

HTTP/1.1 was introduced in 1999 as an upgrade to the original HTTP/1.0, and it has been the most widely used version of HTTP for nearly two decades. It is a text-based protocol where each request and response is sent as a separate message between the client (usually a web browser) and the server. While HTTP/1.1 worked well for simple use cases, it faces several limitations when it comes to modern, complex web applications.

**Key Features of HTTP/1.1:P?**

**Persistent Connections:** HTTP/1.1 introduced the concept of persistent connections, which means that the same TCP connection can be reused for multiple requests and responses. This avoids the overhead of opening and closing connections for every request.

**Pipelining:** HTTP/1.1 supports pipelining, where multiple requests can be sent over a single connection without waiting for responses. However, the responses must still be processed in order, leading to inefficiencies.

**Limited Request Parallelism:** HTTP/1.1 allows only a small number of requests (typically 6) to be made in parallel per server. This leads to the problem known as the “Head-of-Line Blocking” issue, where one slow response can block subsequent requests.

**What is HTTP/2?**

HTTP/2 was released in 2015 as a major revision of the HTTP protocol. It was developed to address the performance limitations of HTTP/1.1, focusing on reducing latency and improving efficiency in data transfer between clients and servers. HTTP/2 is based on Google’s SPDY protocol, which was developed to improve web performance. Unlike HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 is binary rather than text-based and introduces several new features that make web pages load faster and more efficiently.

**Key Features of HTTP/2:**

**Binary Protocol:** HTTP/2 uses a binary format for communication, which is more efficient and less error-prone than the text-based format of HTTP/1.1.

**Multiplexing:** This is one of the most important features of HTTP/2. Multiplexing allows multiple requests and responses to be sent over a single TCP connection simultaneously. This eliminates the need for opening multiple connections and resolves the Head-of-Line Blocking problem.

**Header Compression:**
 HTTP/2 uses HPACK header compression, reducing the size of HTTP headers, which saves bandwidth and reduces latency.

**Stream Prioritization:** HTTP/2 allows requests to be prioritized, meaning that more important resources (like the HTML document) can be sent first, improving page load times.

**Server Push:** HTTP/2 introduces server push, where the server can proactively send resources (like images, CSS files, or JavaScript) to the client without waiting for the client to request them. This reduces the number of round trips needed for page rendering.

**Key Differences Between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2**
---------------------------------
| Feature | HTTP/1.1 | HTTP/2 |
---------------------------------
Protocol Type	| Text-based	| Binary-based
-----------------------------------------
Multiplexing	| No, requests are sent sequentially over a single connection.|	Yes, multiple requests and responses are sent in parallel over a single connection.
---------------------------------------------
Request/Response	|One request per connection, blocking occurs.	|Multiple requests/responses in parallel without blocking.
-------------------------------------------------
Header Compression	|No compression, headers sent in plain text.	|HPACK header compression reduces overhead.
---------------------------------------------------
Connection Reuse	|Persistent connections (but limited).|	One connection for multiple requests, reducing latency.
------------------------------------------------
Prioritization	|No request prioritization.	|Request prioritization allows faster delivery of critical resources.
-------------------------------------------
Server Push	|Not supported|	Supported: the server can push resources to the client before they are requested.
------------------------------------------------
Performance|Slower for modern websites due to blocking and overhead.	|Faster, due to |multiplexing, compression, and server push.

***JavaScript Objects and Their Internal Representation**
===========================================================

JavaScript objects are fundamental data structures in the language. They serve as containers for related data and functionality and are an essential part of working with JavaScript. However, understanding how objects work internally can offer deeper insights into performance, behavior, and memory usage. In this blog, we'll explore what objects are in JavaScript and how they're represented internally.

**What Are JavaScript Objects?**
In JavaScript, objects are collections of key-value pairs where the keys (also known as properties) are strings (or symbols), and the values can be any data type, including other objects, arrays, or functions. These objects are used to represent real-world entities like a person, car, or product.

**For example:I**

const car = {
  make: 'Toyota',
  model: 'Corolla',
  year: 2020
};

In the example above, car is an object with three properties: make, model, and year.

Internal Representation of JavaScript Objects
JavaScript objects are not just simple collections of key-value pairs. Internally, they are represented as a set of properties and their associated values. Here’s how JavaScript engines, like V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js), typically handle the internal representation of objects.

**1. Property Storage:**

Internally, properties of an object are stored in a hidden structure that allows fast access. This structure is often called a property descriptor or hidden class. Each property consists of a key, a value, and some attributes (such as whether the property is writable or enumerable).

For example, when you define the car object, JavaScript engines store the properties make, model, and year in an efficient structure that supports fast property lookup.

**2. Hidden Classes:**
In JavaScript, objects of the same shape (i.e., they have the same set of properties) share a common hidden class. The hidden class is like a blueprint that allows the engine to access the properties of the object more quickly. When you add new properties or change the structure of an object, the engine might generate a new hidden class for that object.

**For example, if you add a color property to the car object:**

car.color = 'red';

The engine may create a new hidden class for the updated object, which now includes the color property. This new hidden class optimizes how the engine accesses properties in the object.

**3. Hash Table / Map:**

Internally, JavaScript engines often use hash tables or hash maps to store and quickly retrieve the values associated with object properties. The property keys are hashed to improve lookup performance, especially for objects with many properties.

The hash table stores references to the values of the properties, and the keys are used to access those values. This structure allows for average constant-time complexity (O(1)) for property lookups, making JavaScript objects quite efficient.

**4. Prototype Chain:**
Every JavaScript object has an internal link to another object called its prototype. This prototype is also an object and can contain properties and methods that are shared by all objects of that type. This creates a chain of objects, where properties are inherited from prototypes.

**For example:**

const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
  }
};

const employee = Object.create(person);
employee.jobTitle = 'Developer';

console.log(employee.fullName()); // John Doe
In this case, the employee object inherits properties and methods from the person object. This inheritance mechanism is called the prototype chain.

**5. Memory Management:**
JavaScript engines also optimize memory usage for objects. When you create an object, the engine allocates memory to store the properties, values, and prototype references. If an object is no longer in use (i.e., there are no references to it), the garbage collector will free up the memory.
